pyXFlow Documentation
=====================

Welcome to pyXFlow, which provides a Python module called :mod:`pyxflow` for
interfacing with XFlow.  In addition to providing an API of sorts for XFlow,
:mod:`pyxflow` contains a number of other utilities.  The main focus of these
is several utilities for creating graphics.  Now it's possible to make vector
graphics easily from XFlow results!
